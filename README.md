# gitStatus
A simple and easy way to check git status on different branches and machines

# Install

Copy the main folder into the main directory i.e. /html/status/


To add new servers to watch-list, add the server information under settings and copy gitStatus to the server you want to monitor

# Notice

Version 3.3 changes the default poll type to two (previous default was poll type one). Poll type two adds support for server group configurations & is possibly more secure.
